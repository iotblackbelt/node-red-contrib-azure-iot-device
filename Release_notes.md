- Updates:
    - Automatic response on desired property changes for IoT Central and PnP devices has been removed. It is up to the flow-logic in Node-Red to confirm receipt. The change has been made because the logic in Node-Red should determine whether action is taken based on desired property updates. Similar to the command (direct method) approach. Examples of root and component the confirmation messages are added to the [use](https://github.com/iotblackbelt/node-red-contrib-azure-iot-device/blob/master/USE.md) document.
    - Documentation: 
        - CONFIGURE.md added: "Currently only CA based X.509 (group) certificates are supported. Individual device certificates are not. Both individual and group SAS Keys are supported."
        - USE.md added: description of "Azure IoT Central and PnP require a specific reported property"
