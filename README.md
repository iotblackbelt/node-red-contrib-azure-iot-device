# Azure IoT Device Node-RED node
The Azure IoT Device Node-RED node is a node that can be used to connect Node-RED to the Azure IoT platform. It can connect to Azure IoT Hub, Azure IoT Central, and use Azure IoT Edge as a transparant gateway. The node has been created to support the different attestation methods (SAS, X.509) as well as use Azure Device Provisioning Service. The node has been developed using the [Azure IoT Node.js SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-node/).

The Azure IoT Device node represents a **single device** on the Azure IoT platform. 

> NB: It is our assumption that you have a basic understanding of [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) and the [Azure IoT platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/product-categories/iot/).

## Deploy the Azure Device node
In the [deploy](https://github.com/iotblackbelt/node-red-contrib-azure-iot-device/blob/master/DEPLOY.md) document we describe how to deploy the node to Node-RED.

## Configure an Azure IoT Device node
In the [configure](https://github.com/iotblackbelt/node-red-contrib-azure-iot-device/blob/master/CONFIGURE.md) document we describe how to setup an individual Azure IoT Device node.

## Use an Azure IoT Device node
In the [use](https://github.com/iotblackbelt/node-red-contrib-azure-iot-device/blob/master/USE.md) document we describe how to use the Azure IoT Device node to interact with the Azure IoT platform.
- sending telemetry
- receiving and responding to commands
- receiving desired properties
- updating reported properties
- receiving C2D messages

## Resilience
The node is developed to resist network loss. If there is no connectivity, the node will try to re-establish a device connection based on the set retry interval. The node doesn't store and forward. All message and properties sent during a loss of connectivity, will be lost.
